<h1>Chapter 3: Keeper of Secrets - Part 1</h1>
<br>
<p class="Samir">The month was July of 2062, and my subway ads were going through a self-improvement phase, or so I liked to call it. In a few days time, they would let up and move on to a new type— the others were usually insurance-related or single-shaming. For now, I was still barraged with a variety of irritating ads. Many were insulting, and some I remember were particularly unnerving: a hair loss cream accompanied by before and after pictures of my own receding hairline, an interior design consultant with a picture of my own living room, decked out in an admittedly appealing baby blue color, with a vase of ruby red roses on my coffee table. At the onset of the NanoCore around five years earlier, shortly before I gained my fortune, they advertised me job opportunities, some of which I dutifully considered. But I had lived my last few years running around and capturing photographs of a certain type, the images of partners stupid enough to cheat on the uber-rich barons of New York City. Now I was marked by the algorithms as a commodity. If I ever chose to supplant my simple but comfortable living conditions with a life of luxury, there was a company out there which stood to gain. <br><br> I was never shown the ads I myself sponsored, of course, but my NanoCore agent would reassure me that those in power did often, whether on a billboard across the street from their window, or on the side of a bus as their limousine drove by. To this day, I don’t know what was in those advertisements - I imagine them like the billboards of my youth, a still image with my face front and center, surrounded by a mysterious slogan, like “Looking to Uncover a Secret?” Alas, the NanoCore companies knew more about me than I did, so I left it all up to them. <br><br>  All that really matters is that whichever way my name was presented to Sidney Hargrave, it left an impression, mostly likely one she didn’t initially recognize (with her aversion in those days to the NanoCore). This connection would ultimately lead me to a discovery much bigger than anything I could ever have imagined.</p>

<p class="Skye">Good morning, and welcome to NewsRadio 101, YOUR number one source for news in our great city. <br><br>Me? I’m your host, Ava Skye. Today’s guest host is New York’s own, Twitter personality turned mayoral candidate John Doe, who is joining us as part of his campaign for Mayor of New York City. <br><br>Welcome to the show, John… or whatever your real name is.</p>
<p class="Doe">Thank you for having me. It's great to be here.</p>
<p class="Skye">So, John, you've made headlines recently with your… how should I put it… unique campaign strategy. <br><br>Can you explain why you've made the decision to maintain your anonymity and only make public appearances as a hologram?</p>
<p class="Doe">Well, the world is changing, and because of that the way we do politics needs to change as well. I want to be able to connect with voters in a way that is more personal and engaging. <br><br>By using holographic technology, I can be present at multiple events at the same time, and have more direct, face to face interactions with the people of New York City.</p>
<p class="Skye">John, as you know, your opponent, incumbent mayor Sidney Hargrave, has made a spectacle of her refusal to advertise via the NanoCore, citing reasons of privacy. As for you, I’ve already seen your avatar on screens all over Times Square. <br><br>Do you not share her concerns? And if not, do you believe the voters will agree with you?</p>
<p class="Doe">Sidney Hargrave is so afraid of the NanoCore that she can’t even leave her own home. <br><br>With all due respect, there aren’t many New Yorkers like Sidney Hargrave.</p>
<p class="Skye">Stay right there, everyone. <br><br>We’re about to speak with former Mayor, Emily Rodriguez, to see what <i>she</i> thinks about John’s curious campaign</p>
